# Spotify Data Analysis Project
## Overview
This project analyzes my Spotify listening history over the last six months. I collected and structured my data into three tables:

Top Tracks – My most-played songs.
Top Artists – Artists I listened to the most.
Featured Artists – Artists featured in the tracks I played.
Using SQL, I queried and analyzed my listening patterns, then visualized the insights.

## Data Collection
The data was gathered directly from my Spotify listening history and structured into a relational database with three main tables.

## Analysis & Visualization
SQL queries were used to extract insights, such as my most-streamed songs and artists.
Data visualization techniques were applied to highlight trends in my listening habits.
## Next Steps
Tableau Integration: Create interactive dashboards for deeper exploration.
Extended Analysis: Incorporate a longer Spotify history to track trends over time.
## Tools & Technologies
SQL for querying and analysis
Python/Pandas for data processing
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations
Tableau (upcoming) for interactive dashboards
